## Degenify

### V2

Deployed at `TBD`.


Consolidate some defi degeneracy you might like to do repeatedly into a single contract call, `apeIntoSushiAndPickle`:

ðŸ¦§ deposit eth and wbtc into the sushiswap liquidity pool

ðŸ¦§ take the resulting slp tokens and deposit them in the correpsonding pickle jar

ðŸ¦§ take the resulting pslp tokens and deposit those in the corresponding pickle farm


Then with `harvestPickle` you can:

ðŸ¦§ harvest pickles


And with `bailOutOfSushiAndPickle` and `withdrawETH`/`withdrawToken`:

ðŸ¦§ de-farm, dis-jar, un-stake, withdraw â€” should your hands prove paper


### V1

All the above, but you can't harvest pickles because you did it wrong. Deployed at `0xcc3eB2EF87B6872b802b58A98BcACe061Fe054dF`.
